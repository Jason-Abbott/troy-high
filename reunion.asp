<b><u>FRIDAY NIGHT - July 20, 2001<br>
</b></u>We are planning on an <b>&quot;EVERY&quot;</b> class social on
Friday night at Mingles around 7pm. Not just our class attending or
invited, but <b>ALL</b> are welcome. Husbands, wives, brothers, sisters,
friends, come one, come all. You may eat a full dinner, or just order
some appetizers while enjoying a brew haw and socializing with old
friends.
<p>
<b><u>SATURDAY - July 21, 2001</u> <br>
8:00am</b> Volleyball Tournament. The Volleyball tournament will start at
8:00am on Saturday morning. (So, don't party too hard on Friday
night....tee hee) We need a commitment from at least 3 guys and 3 girls.
So far this is who we have a commitment from:

Looks like we need some more volunteers from those guys out there. Erik,
Randy, Pope?? If I left anyone off the list let me know and I will be
glad to put you on. The more volunteers the more rest for all of us! We
definitely need at least one more MALE to sign up so we can at least have
a team!<br>
<br>
After the Volleyball tournament you all will be on your own until
<b>around 5pm</b>. At this time we will be having a BBQ, a few beers and
some socializing at Brett Bauer's in Moscow. Bring your suit if you would
like to relax in his hot tub or put on your tennis shoes for some yard
games. Bring your significant other and children if you wish. A map will
be provided with the invitations.<br>
<br>
After we all eat and socialize at Brett's, some of us will plan on
heading back to Troy for the Troy Days street dance.&nbsp; We were
thinking of a<b> 5pm to 9pm time frame</b> at Brett's<b>. <br>
<br>
<u>SUNDAY - July 22, 2001 <br>
</b></u>Volunteers are needed to help us clean up Brett's place. The more
volunteers the quicker we can get it done. PLEASE VOLUNTEER. <br>
<br>
We are still in need of these people's addresses. If any of you can help
with these let me know.<br>
<br>
Bill Hart<br>
Sara Maki<br>
Tara Porter<br>
Darin Werlinger<br>
Matt Young<br>
Jadie Zimmerman<br>
<br>
We would still like to do a biography of your lives the last ten years.  Attach a family photo, single photo, business card and a biography of where you are, your career, how you met your significant other, children, etc. etc . You can send this directly to Aaron by e-mail at <a href='mailto:aranisate@presnellgage.com'>aranisate@presnellgage.com</a> or to Aaron Ranisate, 364 E. Valleyview, Genesse ID 83832.&nbsp; She will be making up the books to give to each of us when we arrive at Brett's.<br>
<br>
To help cover expenses of Volleyball, BBQ items, beer and other expenses
we will be asking you provide us with $15 for a
single attendance or $25 for double. You may send this to Aaron at
the above address.&nbsp; If there is any $$ left over we thought that we
would award the contest winners with a cash prize.&nbsp; This would be
given at Brett's towards the end of the evening once every one had a
chance to vote on categories such as &quot;the most changed&quot;,
&quot;the cutest couple or oddest couple&quot;, &quot;the furthest
away&quot;, &quot;most available&quot;, etc.<br>
<br>
That's about it for now.&nbsp; Let me know if there are any more
Volleyball players out there.

<!-- 
Several of us, spearheaded by Tiffany, Tambi and Aaron, have been exchanging e-mail, hashing out some rough plans.  We'd like more to participate to ensure that the final plans meet with everyone's approval.  For now, it sounds like a float is out.  We'll save that for the 20-year.  A game of co-ed volleyball is probably in.
<p>
We are still trying to decide on a location.  We could rent Pete's Place, a ballroom in Moscow, or use someone's house.  Each has minor pros and cons.
<p>
As Tiffany mentioned, "we want to ask people to type up and send us a biography of themselves and their lives over the last 10 years along with a picture of themselves/family. We want to put this in a memory book for everyone to look at. This way if some people are not able to attend the Reunion they can still submit a biography."  So start writing.  I'm sure that this will make it's way online, as well.
<p>
It would be fun to come up with some videos of our high school activities.  Tiffany, Tambi and Aaron "talked about trying to find those videos we made up about drugs and alcohol and or even trying to find our slides from graduation."  If your parents have some video, cough it up.
<p>
An idea that myself and others liked is having a vote on categories like "the most changed", "the cutest couple or oddest couple", "the furthest away", "most available", etc.
<p>
If you have other ideas, please e-mail the class.
