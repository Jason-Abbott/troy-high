webNav is an ASP based menuing system meant to ease site navigation while being extremely easy to manage.  If you have an ASP compatible server, you can have a copy for your own site for $45, which includes free updates and e-mail based help.  It has the following features:

<p>
<a href="webCal3.asp"><b>webNav 2.0</b></a><br>
<font size=1><u>Created May, 1999</u></font>
<br>
<li>Requires no component or plug-in downloads.  Many of the nice navigation tools require some kind of initial download.  Those that I tested invariably broke with one browser or another.  webNav avoids this problem and so won't turn visitors away from your site.
<li>Complete web based administration, including additions, edits, deletions, and changing the order of menu items.
<li>Includes two menu engines, one utilizing JavaScript for faster operation and one that is completely server-side, for backwards compatibility with all browsers.  A script is included to automatically detect browswer capabilities, and display the proper menu, or you can manually link to either version.  Their appearance is identical and both use the same data source.
<li>Both menu engines are recursive and so support infinite menu depths, limited only by your screen space.
<li>Themes allow you to easily change the colors used in the entire application, to better match your own site, or to change the collapse and expand graphic used within the menu.

<p>
<b>Future features</b><br>
<li>It will change the oil in your car, after washing the dishes.
